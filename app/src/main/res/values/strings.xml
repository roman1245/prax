    <string name="about_text">This application came as alternative to many Library applications. I\'m
        talking about Library with paper books hold in your private or public library. There is no
        application that matched my needs so I created this one.\n\n

        Currently application is just at the beginning, therefor many of intended functionalities are
        not present in it yet. I\'m planning to create beautiful user experience, add book categorization,
        bulk inserting, backup functionality and some more.\n\n

        Hope You are the one that finds this application useful.</string>
